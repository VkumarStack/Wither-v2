## Setup Instructions:
- Clone the repository and ensure that [NodeJS and Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed on your device.
- Ensure that you have access to a MongoDB Cluster. A free, cloud-based cluster can be accessed via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). Alternatively, you can create a database instance on your [local machine](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
- From the root level of the repository, run the command `npm run init` to install all of the appropriate Node modules and create an optimized build version of the frontend application.
- Navigate to the **/server** directory and create a **.env** file. 
    - Append to the **.env** file `DATABASE_URL="DATABASE_URL_INSTANCE"`, where the string contains the URL to your MongoDB database instance
    - Append to the **.env** file `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="KEY"`, where the string contains a randomly generated byte sequence to be used as a private key for user authentication (if this is not provided, the application will default to an insecure key)
- Navigate back to the root level of the repository and run `npm run start` to launch the server and front end client
